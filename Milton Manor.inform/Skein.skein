Traditionally the guest bedroom, the west wing is a simply decorated space. There is a great red curtain on the wall you are now facing. To your right is a closet and dresser. They are made of quality oak and seem to impose themselves into the room, as opposed to fitting in with it. The parts of the room to your left contain the guest bed, the bedside table and the reading lamp on top. There is also a bedroom mirror on the door.

West wing
Traditionally the guest bedroom, the west wing is a simply decorated space. There is a great red curtain on the wall you are now facing. To your right is a closet and dresser. They are made of quality oak and seem to impose themselves into the room, as opposed to fitting in with it. The parts of the room to your left contain the guest bed, the bedside table and the reading lamp on top. There is also a bedroom mirror on the door.
